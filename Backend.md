# ðŸ›  API Backend Architecture for Error Logging Service

## **Overview**

The **API Backend** is responsible for receiving, processing, and storing logs from client applications. It provides a secure, scalable, and performant interface for SDKs to submit error data. Additionally, it triggers real-time alerts for critical errors and serves data to the web dashboard for analysis.

## **1. Goals**

| Goal | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Secure ingestion** | Accept logs from multiple SDKs via HTTPS with API key authentication. |
| **Validation & normalization** | Validate payload structure and enrich with server-side metadata. |
| **Processing & filtering** | Apply filters to remove sensitive information or unwanted logs. |
| **Storage** | Store logs efficiently for fast retrieval and querying. |
| **Real-time alerts** | Notify developers via email or other channels for critical issues. |
| **Scalable architecture** | Handle bursts of error traffic without downtime. |
| **API rate limiting** | Prevent abuse from misconfigured SDKs or malicious clients. |

## **2. Recommended Technologies**

| Layer | Technology | Justification |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| **Backend Framework** | NestJS (TypeScript) | Strong TypeScript support, modular architecture, and easy integration with databases and message queues. |
| **HTTP Server** | Fastify (optional, NestJS compatible) | High-performance request handling, low overhead. |
| **Authentication** | API key with middleware | Lightweight and effective for SDKs; can scale with OAuth/token support later. |
| **Message Queue** | RabbitMQ or Kafka | Decouple log ingestion from processing for reliability and scalability. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB or MongoDB | Structured logs (Postgres) with fast indexing or flexible JSON logs (MongoDB). |
| **Caching / Indexing** | Redis or ElasticSearch | Quick search for recent logs, full-text search, and dashboard queries. |
| **Email Alerts** | SES, SendGrid, or Postmark | Reliable, scalable notifications. |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus + Grafana | Track system health, ingestion rates, and error metrics. |
