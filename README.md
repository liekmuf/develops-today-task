# Error Logging Service - Documentation Hub

**This repository contains the architecture documentation for a test task at `develops-today`.**  
It covers all components of the error logging platform: Client SDKs, API Backend, Web Dashboard, DevOps, and Real-Time Alerts.

---

## **Overview**

This platform allows developers to integrate an error logging service into their applications. It provides:

- Client SDKs for **React, Vue, Angular, Node.js**, and more.
- A scalable **API Backend** for ingestion and processing.
- A **Web Dashboard** with multi-tenant and role-based access.
- **DevOps solutions** for deployment, monitoring, and storage optimization.
- **Real-Time Alerts** for critical errors.
