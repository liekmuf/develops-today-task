# DevOps Architecture for Error Logging Service

## **Overview**

The **DevOps solution** ensures the error logging service (SDKs, API backend, and Web Dashboard) is **scalable, reliable, and maintainable**.  
It covers **deployment, monitoring, logging, storage optimization, and CI/CD** pipelines for all components, supporting multiple tenants and high traffic.

## **1. Goals**

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Scalable Deployment** | Handle increasing SDK log submissions and dashboard traffic. |
| **Monitoring & Alerting** | Observe system health, performance, and failures in real time. |
| **Automated CI/CD** | Continuous integration and deployment for backend, dashboard, and SDKs. |
| **Log Storage Optimization** | Efficient database usage and retention management. |
| **High Availability** | Minimize downtime using load balancing and redundancy. |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Optimize cloud resource usage. |

## **2. Recommended Technologies**

| Layer | Technology | Justification |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| **Containerization** | Docker | Standardized deployment environment, easy scaling. |
| **Orchestration** | Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS) | Automated scaling, service discovery, and self-healing. |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / AWS CodePipeline | Automate testing, builds, and deployments for all services. |
| **Infrastructure as Code** | Terraform / CloudFormation | Versioned and reproducible cloud infrastructure. |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus + Grafana | Metrics collection, dashboards, and alerting. |
| **Log Aggregation** | ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) / Loki + Grafana | Centralized logs for backend services, workers, and dashboard. |
| **Message Queue** | RabbitMQ / Kafka | Decouples log ingestion and processing for scalability. |
| **Storage Optimization** | Partitioned DB tables, TTL, S3 for older logs | Efficient storage and retention policies. |
| **Secrets Management** | HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager | Secure storage of API keys, DB credentials, and other secrets. |
