# Web Dashboard Architecture for Error Logging Service

## **Overview**

The **Web Dashboard** provides developers with a user-friendly interface to view, search, filter, and analyze error logs collected from client SDKs.  
It integrates with the backend API to provide real-time insights, error statistics, and alert management. The system also supports **roles** and a **multi-tenant architecture**, enabling secure access for multiple projects or organizations.
