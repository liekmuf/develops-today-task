# ðŸ“£ Real-Time Alerts Architecture for Error Logging Service

## **Overview**

The **Real-Time Alerts** system ensures that critical errors captured by SDKs are immediately communicated to developers via email and optionally other channels like Slack or webhooks.  
Alerts are integrated with the backend processing pipeline and support multi-tenant and role-based configurations.

## **1. Goals**

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Immediate Notification** | Notify developers as soon as a critical error occurs. |
| **Multi-Channel Support** | Email, Slack, Teams, or webhook notifications. |
| **Configurable Thresholds** | Allow users to define which errors trigger alerts. |
| **Tenant Isolation** | Alerts scoped per project or organization. |
| **Reliable Delivery** | Ensure alerts are delivered even under high load or transient failures. |
| **Alert History & Audit** | Keep a record of sent alerts for review and troubleshooting. |

## **2. Recommended Technologies**

| Component | Technology | Justification |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Email Delivery** | SendGrid / Amazon SES / Postmark | Reliable, scalable email delivery service with templating. |
| **Message Queue** | RabbitMQ / Kafka | Decouple alert generation from sending for reliability and scalability. |
| **Backend Service** | NestJS worker or microservice | Processes alert events and sends notifications. |
| **Templating** | Handlebars / MJML | Customizable email templates with dynamic data. |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus / Grafana | Track alert delivery success, failures, and latency. |
| **Retries & Dead Letter Queue** | Built-in MQ or custom worker logic | Ensure transient failures are retried without losing alerts. |
